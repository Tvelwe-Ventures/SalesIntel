## 1. Technical Architecture Overview

### Architectural Philosophy

The SalesIntel AI architecture is designed around five core principles:

1. **Intelligence-First Design**: Unlike traditional systems built primarily for data storage with analytics as an afterthought, SalesIntel AI places intelligence generation at the architectural center, with all other components supporting this function.

2. **Integration Over Addition**: The architecture prioritizes seamless integration with existing systems rather than creating another standalone application. This philosophy manifests in robust APIs, embedded experiences, and flexible connection frameworks.

3. **Adaptive Learning Systems**: The architecture incorporates continuous learning loops throughout all components, allowing the system to improve through usage rather than requiring manual updates and reconfigurations.

4. **Experience-Oriented Engineering**: Technical decisions prioritize the end-user experience, particularly focusing on minimizing cognitive load and delivering insights within existing workflows.

5. **Secure By Design**: Security is built into the architecture from the foundation, not added as an overlay, with particular attention to data handling, model behavior, and integration security.

### System Layers & Components
